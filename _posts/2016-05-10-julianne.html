<h1>Interviews with MouseBees: Today's interview is with Julianne.</h1>
<h1>Julianne is the second MouseBee made. She is very special to me, and here's why:</h1>

<h3>Hi, Julianne</h3>
<p>Hello! I am very happy to be here!</p>

<h3>What can you tell me about yourself?</h3>
<p>Oh! Well, I am a MouseBee. I am totally hypoallergenic and washable, because I was a prototype for a child-safe plush, but… I didn’t turn out quite right.</p>

<h3>Well that’s not exactly true.</h3>
<p>I know that my left arm is too short.</p>

<h3>Now hold on. Do you know where you got your name?</h3>
<p>I think I am named after Colette’s dad, Julian.</p>

<h3>That’s right! Colette’s dad was born with a shortened left arm.His mom was given a medication when she was pregnant with him to reduce morning sickness called Thalidomide. This was a medical mistake, which we have since realized and no one is given Thalidomide because it results in fetal deformities. Colette’s dad was born that way, but then he did all the things he wanted to do that people said he couldn’t. He flew planes and rode motorcycles, and always insisted on sitting in the Exit row on airplanes because he knew he was as good as anyone. Some of Colette’s fondest memories are from practicing sparring when she was in karate as a kid. He almost always won, and then helped her back up again.</h3>
<p>So my short arm was a mistake?</p>

<h3>Not at all! Each animal Colette makes is unique, and seems to have a part in their own creation. Your arm is short, which only makes you your own creature. You’re not broken, just you.</h3>
<p>Okay! I get it! So even though my arms aren’t the same length, I am still just as good as other MouseBees?</p>

<h3>Very much so, Colette is very proud of you.</h3>
<p>Well I am very happy to be me, then, but I don’t think I want to fly planes or ride motorcycles. Is that okay?</p>

<h3>Very okay! You should only do what you want to do!</h3>
<p>I just want to eat cheese and honey. I like them a lot. I also really like playing the Mouse Game.</p>

<h3>Well then, let’s make sure you get all the cheese and honey you’d like! And let's play the Mouse Game, do you want to start?</h3>
<p>Yay! And no, you can have first move, but I'm gonna win this time!</p>
