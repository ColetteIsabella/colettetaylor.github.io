<h1>This is the beginning of my series:</h1>
<h1>Interviews with Flying Sloths: Today's interview is with Thomas.</h1>
<h2>Thomas was the third flying sloth born, but the first to be adopted. (Sorry ladies and gentlemen). He lives with my partner, Clayton, where he gets a lot of love and just the right number of adventures.</h2>
<h3>What’s your name?</h3>
<p>“Uhm. My name is Thomas, but I really like to, uhm, write. I think I am very good at it, so uh, I will write my name for you.”</p>

<h2 class="caption">Thomas is very good at writing.</h2>

<h3>That’s not how you spell your name. </h3>
<p>”Well, uhm, I tried to write it like, uhm, Colette said it was spelled, uh, but I, uhm, couldn’t figure out where the ‘h’ goes, because my name is, um, Tooom-as, not THHHom-as.”</p>

<h3>What about the extra “S’s”?</h3>
<p>”Well… I got to the um, ’S’ part, and I just really like drawing, uhm, S’s, so I decided to keep, um, going.”</p>

<h3>What do you like about “S’s”?</h3>
<p>Uhm. I like that they are, uhm, just like how they sound. And I like that I can draw them nice and slow.”</p>

<h3>That makes sense. So what else do you like to do?</h3>
<p>”I like to help. And I like to listen. I live with Clayton. He was there when I was born, and named me, and I, uhm, just kind of grabbed onto him, and didn’t let go.”</p>
<p>”I have magnets in my paws. So that helps.”</p>
<p>"I also really, uhm, like coffee. Uhm, but mostly the sugar, um, part, and also the buzzy part."</p>

<h3>That’s True. But you also like to hang out on his couch, right?</h3>
<p>”Yes. I like to watch movies with Clayton and Colette. Or one time, I got to play video games with them. Uhm, I was not very good, but it was fun to try. Also, Colette usually covers my eyes if it gets too scary.”</p>

<h3>Well, you are still very young.</h3>
<p>”That’s true. I uhm, I am 3.”</p>

<h3>No you’re not.</h3>
<p>”Oh. Well, uhm, I guess then, um, I am 1.”</p>

<h3>Not quite</h3>
<p>”Well, those are my two favorite numbers, I am not sure what else I could be. I helped do Clayton’s taxes this year. It was, uhm, very hard because he used, um, a lot more numbers than 1 and uh, 3.”</p>

<h3>I be… </h3>
<p>”It was, uhm, very complicated. I don’t know how he counts, um, so many numbers.”</p>

<h3>Well, I think he uses more than one of his paws.</h3>
<p>”Yes. I guess, uhm, he uses his back paws as well.”</p>

<h3>You sound like you might be very shy.</h3>
<p>”Uhm, not really, I just, uhm, don’t like talking as much as I like, um, hugging and listening, and, uhm, cuddling.”</p>

<h3>That makes sense. How do you feel about your cousins?</h3>
<p>”Yes. Uhm, I like them. Marv visits the most, uhm because Colette brings him over. But, uhm, it seems like Kimmy is very, uhm, nice. She, uhm, patted my head when I first visited. And, well, Walt is still working on, uhm, talking, but I taught him how to write S’s, uhm, even though he doesn’t have any in his name. And Vanessa is a very good mom. Uhm. Maybe Walt will be able to write his mom’s name! That has S’s. Van -essssssss-ah.”</p>

<h3>True. What about Maggie?</h3>
<p>”Maggie is, uhm, she is very excited about exploring. She’s uhm, a little loud, and she’s as big as Walt, but, uhm, she’s very adventurous. Kimmy had to stop her from, uhm, riding on the cats when I was there. Then they both did.”</p>

<h3>Did you ride on the cats?</h3>
<p>”Uhm,  no. They are too fast when they are awake. So, uhm, I just patted Patrick when he was asleep.”</p>

<h3>Thank you, Thomas</h3>
<p>”Uhm, of course. Can, uhm, can I hug you?”</p>

<h3>Absolutely!</h3>
<p>*Muffled uhm’s as he climbs my arm, followed by a hug and tiny: “UhmYay!”*</p>
