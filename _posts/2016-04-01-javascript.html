<h1>Apps I have made</h1>
<h2>I've been learning how to code, and in so doing, I have made some simple javascript-based apps which are very silly, but make me happy.</h2>
<div class= "app-separate">
<h2>The Leslie Knope App</h2>
<p>I made this app around my enjoyment of the show Parks and Recreation, and the mode by which Leslie talks to Ann. I can never get a good line right off the top of my head, so I created a generator:</p>

<h2>Alternate TimeZone App</h2>
<p>So in the last few months, I went from a very regimented cycle of night and day cycle, to a strange sort of sleep-when-I-pass-out method.</p>
<p>This has a lot of factors influencing its results, and can vary wildly every few days. One night, I am up until 6 am coding or making a new stuffie, and then I can't sleep for 23 hours, and wake up sometime the next night.</p>
<p>This works as a freeelancer, and has been merciful with my depressive cycles, but my partner, who was on a similar schedule, and I began joking that it was like we were waking up in a different timezone every day, so we wondered: Where were we waking up. And sinceit's me, I created an app to find out:</p>
<h2 class="leslie"><a href="/timezone/index.html">When the F*ck Are You?</a></h2>
