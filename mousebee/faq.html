<h1>What Is MouseBee?</h1>
<p><em>Currently, this part of the site is a work-in-progress, so I thought I would toss in a quick Q&A while I build it out</em></p>
<h2>The origin of the name:</h2>
<p>Over the years, I have always been creative, and wanted to share my ideas and creations with the world. When I was a kid, that took the form of "Mouse Inc." This was when I was Mousegirl by my parents. With Mouse Inc., I made little gifts, and decorations specifically for friends and family.</p>
<img class="inc" src="/assets/mouseinc.jpg">
<p>As I got better at crafting, and started making more complicated pieces, I joined Etsy as "Anatomy of a Beekeeper", and worked as Colette Isabella. My work was noticed by Cory Doctorow of boingboing.net, and I was featured on their "100 Best nerd gifts of 2011". My work was based around science and my nerdy interests.</p>
<img class="inc" src="/assets/beestamp.jpg">
<p>Throughout all this, I have been avoiding the fact that creating beautiful things is what I love to do, and I want to keep doing it professionally, so I hybridized my two identities, thus: "MouseBee".</p>

<p>So came the hybrid, and my new shop has a new symbol. </p>

<h2>Who is Izzy the MouseBee?</h2>
<p>Izzy the MouseBee is my mascot. I have decided to reclaim my self as only the artist, and not the foreground.I figure she'll take a few forms, but this is the original: </p>

<h2>Where did Marv come from?</h2>
<p>A year ago, I got my first copy of Ms. Marvel with Kamala Khan by G. Willow Willson, art by Adrian Alphona. My partner at the time, read it first, and said: <em>"There is something in here, which you will findyourself... wanting. But remember you have a lot of work, so pease don't just up and start a new project."</em></p>
<p><em>"Guh"</em> Thought I, <em>"I have more self-control than that."</em> I was wrong. Just a few pages in, I saw this:</p>
<img class="marvel clearfix" src="/assets/slothmsmarvel.png">
<p>Yeah...</p>
<h2>Why Marv? 's a dumb name.</h2>
<p>Each stuffie I make has its own unique personality. I usually have an idea when I start, but as I work, the character forms itself.</p>
<p>When I first started "Marv", I thought he would be a she, and I would call her Kamala, but I got just past the formation of his head, and I realized he was a "he" and a bit of a dandy at that, so he became Marv, partly to still keep with the Ms. Marvel inspiration, and the first thing I made for him to wear was a top hat. He goes with me to Conventions where I work, and just about anywhere else I feel would benefit from a flying sloth. He had a particularly good time at a friend's wedding.</p>
<h2>How does he stay on your shoulder?</h2>
<p>Each flying sloth I make has a neodynium magnet in each paw. This means that I can attach him to whatever I am wearing by just putting his paws together, or a kitchen magnet inside my shirt.</p>
<p>**I have yet to do all the research on Neodynium magnets on pace makers or other electronic assistance devices. Neodynium is the strongest magnet I can find so it works through multiple layers of fabric. I will say, I generally keep Marv away from my phone and computer, as much to keep him from posting inappropriate things to Facespace as him damaging the harddrive. :)</p>
<h2>How well do they fly?</h2>
<p>This is a very touchy subject for Marv. I think that the wings are vestigial, but he hasn't really opened up about it.</p>
<h2>They don't look like sloths that much... or very much the same as eachother.</h2>
<p>That's true. I have 4 colors of brown, and although the eyes always follow the same basic rules to look like a 3 toed sloth, the extra patterning is just part of the personality I am able to give them, so I let spots, and light underbellies, and socks happen as they do. I think it adds to the whimsy of them, and maybe someday I will have a sloth who just wants to be one color, but as with their names, gender, and style, I have to wait to see what happens.</p>
<h2>Where Are you Going With This?</h2>
<p> My current plan, is to make 8 or 10 initial Marv cousins. I post updates on their progress to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AnatomyOfABeekeeper/">Anatomy of a Beekeeper</a> on Facebook, and will be updating major events to my <a href="/index.html">mailing list</a>. I want everyone who wants one to be able to have their very own flying sloth!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading! I hope you stick with me as I develop MouseBee!</p>
