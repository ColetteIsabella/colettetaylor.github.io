<h1>Pay What You Can</h1>
<h2>Hi! If you are here, you saw a piece of mine which you fell in love with, but you are in a situation where you can't afford it. I hear that, I have been there many times, which is why I created this alternative.</h2>
<h3>So here's the deal: I put a tremendous amount of time, energy and love into each of my pieces. I work hard to make unique and well made creations all the way to the packaging.</h3>
<h3>Additionally, I am going through a pretty intense period of my life, and my work is a little bit all I have right now, so in order to aid in my efforts to get myself back on my feet</h3>
<h3>All of that is reflected in the cost, but I also understand <em>needing</em> something, but not being able to afford it, so I have come up with this:</h3>

<form action="MAILTO:coletteisabella@gmail.com" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
<p>Name:</p>
<input type="text" name="name" required>

<p>Email: (So I can get back to you)</p>
<input type="text" name="email" required>

<p>Without too much personal detail, what do you feel qualifies you for a reduced cost?</p>
<textarea rows="6" cols="50" name="reason" required></textarea>

<p>Do you have anything you would like to suggest for trade, a payment system, or other compensation? </p>
<textarea rows="6" cols="50" name="trade"></textarea>

<input type="submit" value="Submit" class="submit">
</form>
