  <h2>Colette Isabella Taylor</h2>
    <p>Colette Taylor was born and raised in Colorado, where she was constantly exposed to the weird. Her parents called her Mousegirl, though sometimes she was Super Coletti, and with that, she was doomed?<br/>
    Destined?<br/>
    Something like that.<br/>
    To be strange.
    </p>
    <p>To this point, she has been a beekeeper, a molecular biologist, a storyteller, a traveller, a writer, a teacher, a software developer, a Convention manager, a seamstress, a crafter, and a Maker.

    <p>She lives in Seattle, Washington with her two cats, <em>Doctor Patrick Fibonacci Waffles</em>, an aptly named Russian Blue mix rescue, who brings gifts to guests and is terrified for the safety of people in showers, and <em>Mollybee Yoyodyne</em>, an underweight mutt who withstood the breaking of her hips, and the death of 9 teeth before she was found. Since her surgery and with the loving attention of Doctor Waffles, she is a spry old lady who just wants to make bisquits all day.

    It's been a tumultuous year for the trio, but they are nothing if not determined. Colette is working on her passion of bringing wonderful and sweet things to the world. Her current project is the creation of Marv's, flying sloths with magnets in their paws. With her experience, though, her prevailing job is never getting bored, because there is always something new to learn or build.

    <p>Follow the adventures, won't you, of Colette and her flying sloths, or contact her to ask about commissions or with interesting jobs.

    <h2>MouseBee</h2>
    <p>MouseBee is the new company identity for Colette Isabella. It comes from a mash-up of her shops over the years, first Mouse Inc. then Anatomy of a Beekeeper.</p>
    <p>Izzy the MouseBee is the new mascot, over her previous hair outline, and the new company will start with the sale of her first real series, Marv and His Cousins; flying sloths with magnets in their paws.</p>
